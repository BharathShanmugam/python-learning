Subject: Application for Entry-Level Role in Backend and Cloud Development

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the entry-level position at [Company Name]. With a background in backend development, API integration, and cloud technologies, I am eager to contribute my technical skills and passion for building efficient, scalable solutions.

Following my graduation with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I joined TekStructer as a Backend Engineer intern, where I have gained eight months of hands-on experience in optimizing backend systems and developing APIs within AWS Cloud environments. In my role, I have contributed to various projects, such as building a productivity app with FastAPI and Docker and integrating third-party services like WhatsApp and Razorpay for a CRM application. These projects taught me the value of performance optimization and the importance of user-centric design in a collaborative team setting.

I am highly motivated to further develop my skills in backend and cloud development, and I am excited by the potential to contribute to innovative projects at [Company Name]. Attached is my resume, which provides additional details about my experience and skills. I would also love to learn about any current or upcoming opportunities at your company.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I could be a valuable addition to your team.

Warm regards,
Bharath Shanmugam
